### Day 2: November 28, 2021
* Created a whimsical chart to begin to visualize my ideal progression for the player from start to finish.
* Created the game to be completed within 4 playable chapters.
* Each chapter resembles a single day in prison, meaning the player has 4 days to escape.
* Created a google doc where I began to moc up a script for the story progression.
* Player only has 4 days to escape because they have a team who will wait 4 days to rescue them.
* Began some minor research into Twine.

### Day 1: November 27, 2021
* Began brainstorming ideas for my text based game.
* The two ideas that stuck with me were to simulate a prison break, or to navigate the player through a crash landing of an alien planet.
* Brainstormed possible workflows of what each project would consist of, and given the requirements for the course project decided the prison break theme fit best.
* Downloaded Twine.
